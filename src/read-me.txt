My solution:

UPDATE:
Changed hashmap to ConcurrentHashMap for thread safety. Replaced combined
put/getOrDefault statement with a call to putIfAbsent and storing the
result in an optional. Check optional for value for updating value if key
already exist. Using computeIfPresent to update value when key already
exists.

I choose to use a hashmap for its speed with random access. With the songId
stored as the key and the number of plays as its values, it is quick to
insert/retrieve a given songs number of plays. For the getTopNPlays method,
I choose to use stream api. This choice was made because method requires
returning a list, which is made easy with the stream api's collect method.
Additionally, using stream api allowed the use of sorted, limit, and map.
By using these methods, I was able to achieve my solution without having to
convert the hashmap to an array first. This also allowed for only the necessary
number of elements to be added to the list by using the limit method.
